Mars Global Surveyor utilities(for radio occultation) ![occultation](normal.png)

This example is simply of reading MGS .sri high-level occultation data and plotting.


Example:
--------
``` run MGSeds.m ``` makes the plots for all the .sri, .lbl pairs in the current directory


Finding Data Files:
--------------------
Since this was a one-off exploration of something, I [manually picked which files to download](http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mgs/rsdata.html) based on the particular article I was reading.
I have included a couple *.lbl, *.sri files for you to try.
